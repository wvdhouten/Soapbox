# Soapbox
The goal of this project is to create a highly customizable/extendable blog engine for individuals or teams. It does this by trying to leverage the features and libraries available to the .NET (Core) platform.

## Usage
For now, the simplest way to set up your own instance of Soapbox is to clone the repository, build a deployment package, and deploy to the environment of your choice.

The first user you'll create will automatically be set up as the site administrator, any subsequent users will be created as subscribers. If you want to prevent users from registering. Go into the site settings on the admin panel, and disable user registration.

An even simpler way, is to deploy the solution from the button below:

[![Deploy to Azure](https://aka.ms/deploytoazurebutton)](https://portal.azure.com/#create/Microsoft.Template/uri/https%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2Fwvdhouten%2FSoapbox%2Fmain%2Fdeploy%2Fazuredeploy.json)
